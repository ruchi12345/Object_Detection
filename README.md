# Object_Detection

# Installation
 # For CPU 
 TensorFlow, you can just do pip install tensorflow
# For GPU
pip install tensorflow-gpu

# Other Libraries
The remaining libraries can be installed on Ubuntu 16.04 using via apt-get:

sudo apt-get install protobuf-compiler python-pil python-lxml python-tk
pip install --user Cython
pip install --user contextlib2
pip install --user jupyter
pip install --user matplotlib

Alternatively, users can install dependencies using pip:

pip install --user Cython
pip install --user contextlib2
pip install --user pillow
pip install --user lxml
pip install --user jupyter
pip install --user matplotlib

## COCO API installation

Download the cocoapi and copy the pycocotools subfolder to the tensorflow/models/research directory if you are interested in using COCO evaluation metrics. The default metrics are based on those used in Pascal VOC evaluation. To use the COCO object detection metrics add metrics_set: "coco_detection_metrics" to the eval_config message in the config file. To use the COCO instance segmentation metrics add metrics_set: "coco_mask_metrics" to the eval_config message in the config file.

git clone https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi.git
cd cocoapi/PythonAPI
make
cp -r pycocotools <path_to_tensorflow>/models/research

## Protobuf Compilation

The Tensorflow Object Detection API uses Protobufs to configure model and training parameters. Before the framework can be used, the Protobuf libraries must be compiled. This should be done by running the following command from the tensorflow/models/research/ directory:

# From tensorflow/models/research/
protoc object_detection/protos/*.proto --python_out=.

Manual protobuf-compiler installation and usage

If you are on linux:

Download and install the 3.0 release of protoc, then unzip the file.

# From tensorflow/models/research/
wget -O protobuf.zip https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases/download/v3.0.0/protoc-3.0.0-linux-x86_64.zip
unzip protobuf.zip

Run the compilation process again, but use the downloaded version of protoc

# From tensorflow/models/research/
./bin/protoc object_detection/protos/*.proto --python_out=.

Add Libraries to PYTHONPATH

When running locally, the tensorflow/models/research/ and slim directories should be appended to PYTHONPATH. This can be done by running the following from tensorflow/models/research/:

# From tensorflow/models/research/
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:`pwd`:`pwd`/slim

Testing the Installation

You can test that you have correctly installed the Tensorflow Object Detection
API by running the following command:

python object_detection/builders/model_builder_test.py
